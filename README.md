# Configuration
Please copy file `Config.h.local` into `Config.h` and define your MQTT and Network credentials there before building the firmware. The firmware expectsusing static IP address to save a battery energy. OTA is not implemented on purpose since it doesn't work out of the box in a deep sleep mode.

> Make sure not to commit your credentials to Git. `Config.h` is ignored in file .gitignore.

# TODO
* Enable local AP mode to change WiFi creds without firmwaring it
